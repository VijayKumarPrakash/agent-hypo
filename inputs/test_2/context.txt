EXPERIMENT: Project Hermes - AI-Assisted Drafting Efficiency
DATE CONDUCTED: November 1, 2025 - November 14, 2025
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Aris Thorne, UX Research Div.

1. OVERVIEW
This experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a new "SmartDraft" feature within our proprietary document editing software. The feature uses a lightweight language model to suggest sentence completions and tone corrections in real-time.

The primary objective was to determine if SmartDraft reduces the time required to draft a standard professional email without compromising the quality of the output.

2. METHODOLOGY
- Design: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).
- Participants: 400 existing users of the software, stratified by self-reported typing proficiency. (The full dataset is provided in the accompanying CSV).
- Task: All participants were asked to draft a formal "Apology for Missed Deadline" email based on a provided prompt containing specific facts that needed to be included.

3. EXPERIMENT GROUPS
- Control Group: Users utilized the standard text editor with basic spell-check only.
- Treatment Group: Users utilized the text editor with the "SmartDraft" sidebar enabled (predictive text and tone suggestions).

4. MEASUREMENTS & DATA DICTIONARY
The accompanying CSV file contains the following columns:

- user_id: Unique identifier for the participant.
- group_assignment: 
    - "Control": Standard editor.
    - "Treatment": SmartDraft enabled.
- typing_speed_wpm: The user's baseline typing speed in Words Per Minute (measured in a pre-test). This is a covariate.
- task_time_sec: (Primary Metric) The total time in seconds taken from opening the prompt to clicking "Send".
- quality_score: (Secondary Metric) A score from 0-100 assigned by blind reviewers grading the final email on clarity, tone, and inclusion of required facts.
- corrections_count: The number of times the user used the backspace key or deleted text (proxy for frustration/errors).
- satisfaction_rating: Post-task survey response to "How easy was this task?" (Scale 1-10, where 10 is easiest).

OUTCOME MEASURE:
The primary outcome measure is task_time_sec, which is the time taken to complete the email draft. This is the main metric the experiment was designed to test.

The other ones are secondary outcome measures, which we may or may not use in the analysis:
- quality_score (Quality of the email)
- corrections_count (Error/frustration proxy)
- satisfaction_rating (User sentiment)

5. HYPOTHESES
- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in `task_time_sec` between the Control and Treatment groups.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The Treatment group will have a lower `task_time_sec` than the Control group.

6. NOTES FOR ANALYST
- Please check for outliers in `task_time_sec`; some users may have left the window open while taking a break.
- Consider `typing_speed_wpm` as a confounding variable; faster typists might be faster regardless of the tool.
